# Win32 Disk Imager

This project was rewritten from Win32 Disk Imager (http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/). Both interface and function are basically the same. The difference is that the project was written using Win32 native technology, while the original project was written in QT. Therefore, the release file of this project is very small. 
This program can run on Windows XP.
