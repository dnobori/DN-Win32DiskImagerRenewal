Image Writer for Microsoft Windows
Release 1.0.0 - The "Holy cow, we made a 1.0 Release" release.
======
About:
======
This utility is used to read and write raw image files to SD and USB memory devices.
Simply run the utility, point it at your raw image, and then select the
removable device to write to.

This utility can not write CD-ROMs.  USB Floppy is NOT supported at this time.

Future releases and source code are available on our Sourceforge project:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/

This program is Beta, and has no warranty. It may eat your files,
call you names, or explode in a massive shower of code. The authors take
no responsibility for these possible events.

===================
Build Instructions:
===================
Requirements:
1. Now using QT 5.7/MinGW 5.3.  

Short Version:
1. Install the Qt Full SDK and use QT Creator to build.  
   See DEVEL.txt for details

=============
New Features:
=============
Verify Image - Now you can verify an image file with a device.  This compares
the image file to the device, not the device to the image file (i.e. if you
write a 2G image file to an 8G device, it will only read 2G of the device for
comparison).
Additional checksums - Added SHA1 and SHA256 checksums.
Read Only Allocated Partitions - Option to read only to the end of the defined partition(s).  Ex:  Write a 2G image to a 32G device, reading it to a new file will only read to the end of
the defined partition (2G).
Save last opened folder - The program will now store the last used folder in
the Windows registry and default to it on next execution.
Additional language translations (thanks to devoted users for contributing).
